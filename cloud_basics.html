<p>
Everywhere at present, All we hear is "cloud". <br>
But, Cloud can't be the future. Yet, Cloud can extend or provide a pathway towards the future. <br>
Cloud is seen more like a "stack" connected to systems with the help of networks, where data is stored in Servers. <br>
Learning about Cloud like a crazy freak since 2011... In early 2013, Someone (not-experienced in networks) asked "What is Cloud? and How could it be different from Servers?" <br>
That was really tough to answer... In 2 years, that one question broke me.. <br>
Answer isn't tough because now it's 2015 and i know the answer. <br>
Like already said that Cloud is more like "stack", where stack serves in the form of "infrastructure", "platform" or "software". <br>
Normal servers provides as a platform for hosting services such as webpages, where data is being stored in databases. <br>
For list of servers --> <a href="http://ashumeow.github.io/ashumeow/server_basics.html">click here</a> <br>
When it comes to cloud, it is the combination of those servers where it also has a dedicated server and also, a datacenter for each region. <br>
With the help of cloud technology, the predictive modelling is processed through the set of predictions with the help of predictive analysis known as machine learning that is being done. <br> This cool mechanism is also known as big data analytics. <br>
Then, cloud server also used as a storage purpose (similar to normal web servers), but it has got it's own dedicated server as a plus. <br>
Also, cloud application deployment is being performed with the help of a built-in command line interface with languages known as Cloud SDK (Software Development Kit). The success of deployment of applications thereby results in hosting the application on cloud. <br>
The cloud computing concept is more similar to grid computing, where grid computing is a kind of distributed/parallel computing that is formed by a cluster of networks. <br>
Looks like I have answered my question and also, added some more too. <br>
That's how current cloud technology looks like! ;)
